    "sentence" + ".")

Part 2 - Variables Practice
1. In your Console
Type and run the following:
    animal = "dogs"
    print(animal + " are really cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following:
    1. What happens? it prints dogs are really cool.
    2. How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead? animal = cats

2. In your Console
Type and run the following code:
print(dogs + " are cool.")
In your Notebook
Respond to the following questions:
    1. What output does this produce? An error
    2. Why does this happen? Dogs is not in quotes so it is read as a variable with no value.
